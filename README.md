# harambefd-plugin
This is a plugin for Harambe Final Destination, mainly for handeling Custom Gui on minecraft 1.20.4.
I can't code java, I suck so baddd. But even if I can't code java that won't stop me, Harambe Final Destination will be my final destination! 
So my code probally looks weird since chatgpt is helping, so please don't judge me. But most of the code does what I want and that's what matters!!
